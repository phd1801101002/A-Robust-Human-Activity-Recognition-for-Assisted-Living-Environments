This dataset is collected using depth sensor of KinectV2 device. Dataset contains 104 activity instances of 5 different activities. Each activity was performed
by 6 different actors in two/three iterations. Each actor performed at least one of the activity in eight different variations (i.e., four angles, and four positions
at varying distance). Figure 3 shows the sample JPD and BAD based images generated using our algorithms mentioned in our paper. Both JPD and BAD based images are sufficiently distinguishable and were successfully used to classifiy different activities.

Dataset depth data (.dat files) and skeleton data (.csv files). The naming used for files are as follows: 
a01- Activity number (Ranging from 01 to 05, 01- Arm wave, 02- Hand Clap, 03- Forward Kick, 04- Walk, 05- Fall)
s01- Actor number    (From 01 to 06, for six different actors)
e01- Iteration number (From 01 to 03, for each activity, 04 to 10 for activity with variations)
